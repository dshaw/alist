# ISSUE #3

As we wrap up 2017 and start December, I’m heading to CloudNativeCon and KubeCon in 
Austin, TX. Node.js, the CloudNative Runtime, has had a great year and we are poised to 
grow even more in 2018. 
The Node.js project is focusing on improving diagnostics tooling, engaging the 
end users and ensuring all 8.5 million Node.js users world-wide have the best, 
most productive experience possible with the platform.


## Strategic Initiatives

Following Node.js Interactive 2017, I kicked off several strategic initiatives around 
the Node.js project to gain first-hand context to be better able to help improve our 
systems and processes. I volunteered to help iterate on project [Governance](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/383) under 
the auspices of the Node.js Technical Steering Committee (TSC). 
That’s been slow going so far. Additionally, I kicked off an ambitious initiative on 
the the Node.js Community Committee (CommComm) around End User Feedback. 
That has made steady progress and we just passed a major milestone: 
our first official team meeting.

- [Node.js End User Feedback (NEUF) Initiative](https://github.com/nodejs/user-feedback/): The Node.js End User Feedback team works 
with Node.js end users to provide a bi-directional feedback channel 
for the Node.js project through surveys, meetings and outreach.
  - On the official [Node.js Calendar](http://nodejs.org/calendar). We meeting bi-weekly at 9am PT starting Friday, 
  December 1st.
  - [2016-12-01 Node.js End User Feedback Team Meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrOXMIlcvoQ) - Recording of the first official meeting. Join us.
I have one more strategic initiative brewing and it’s actually under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). More on that soon.

## News 
It with great pleasure that I can announce that I am working with Cian O'Maiden and 
the rest of the team at nearForm as Strategic Advisor. 
[nearForm](http://nearform.com/) was founded about the same time as 
The Node Firm back in 2011 in the early days of commercializing Node.js. Since then, 
Cian and his team have continued to invest in Node.js and the community. Today, 
nearForm delivers end-to-end, full-stack services leveraging open source technologies. 
They are a perfect partner in my mission to grow Node.js and better align 
Node.js with the Web Platform.
