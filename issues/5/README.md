# ISSUE #5

## Opening


Current status: ✈️✈️✈️

We have completed the first half of the calendar year 2018 and, wow, has this been a big year for travel. June brought me to Europe with visits to Berlin, Prague, Budapest, Italy, Geneva and Austria. It was a joy to connect with folks who are passionate about Node.js, the open web and open standards throughout the world.
July brings me to kicking off a new Open Source company. I’ll begin to share more at Node Summit. Expect public details around JS Interactive. If you have needs around Open Source, Open Governance and Open Standards, now is a great time to [reach out to discuss](mailto:open@dshaw.com).

### Frameworks  versus Reference Implementations

[Always Forward with dshaw: Architect's View on Frameworks  versus Reference Implementations on Crowdcast](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/dshawaf5?utm_campaign=Revue%20newsletter&utm_medium=Newsletter&utm_source=dshaw%E2%80%94A%20List)

The role of the Software Architect is to align a company on the best practices for building software at a company. Most Architects are not coding in their day-to-day. When Waterfall development was prevalent, this often meant creating UML documents and high-level architecture design docs and requirements.
Today, the primary tools for aligning how fast-moving teams create applications are internal frameworks or reference implementations. We will explore what works and what doesn’t work.

Be sure to join Tara Z. Manicsic on Tuesday July 10th at 10am PT for [#dshawaf6](https://twitter.com/hashtag/dshawaf6) for an in-depth discussion on Modules (both ES Modules and CommonJS Modules) with Myles Borins, Jordan Harband and CJ Silverio. [Topics and agenda](https://github.com/dshaw/alwaysforward/issues/18) for the show are open. [Save your spot for the live show](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/dshawaf6).

### dshaw Hacker Bio

I was honored to be the first Hacker Bio. So much of what I have learned along my professional journey has been through what others have shared. I was a great pleasure to give back to those who come after me.

### [Dan Shaw | Hacker:Bio](https://hacker.bio/hackers/dan-shaw/?utm_campaign=Revue%20newsletter&utm_medium=Newsletter&utm_source=dshaw%E2%80%94A%20List)

Great first episode of @TheHackerBio by @AhmadNassri where @dshaw discusses working in tech, making career changes, perseverance, and giving back to the community.

## News 

#### Accountable Company [Microsoft Acquiring GitHub?]
Microsoft has just acquired GitHub… and that’s a good thing. Now what?
![Accountable Company](https://s3.amazonaws.com/revue/items/images/003/176/017/mail/1*6wdyIBsQf4j1iII7mVB7iQ.jpeg?1530806483)

Now we should continue to hold Microsoft accountable for their stewardship of our code, our collaborative space and our community.
Let me share my experiences of why I think this acquisition is a good one for all parties. [read here….](https://medium.com/@dshaw/accountable-company-8c257e84d34e)

## Strategic Initiative

#### ECMA and TC39

Members of the Node.js project have begun engaging with TC39 helping better define the needs of the ECMAScript spec and the JavaScript language as it evolves. Much of ECMAScript’s history and evolution has been defined by the needs of browser vendors. Today’s full stack world has evolved and Node.js is directly hosting or indirectly executing today’s JavaScript tooling. The need for collaboration is greater than ever.


#### Standards and Governance for Node.js and the Web Platform
