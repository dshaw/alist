# ISSUE #4

I hope everyone had a wonderful Holiday, Winter Break and New Year with your friends 
and family. I had a very family-focused holiday and spent most of the time offline. 
It was grand and I feel recharged and ready to blow 2018 wide open. Let’s do this!

## Always Forward with dshaw

One of my favorite aspects of podcasting is that it captures tone in a way that is 
impossible to convey with text. There are a ton of important issues we need to 
work through in 2018. Many of them are complex and/or delicate. We are going to need 
tone and context to align on these issues.
Starting January 9th, 2018, on the 2nd Tuesday of the month at 10am PT, 
I will record Always Forward with dshaw. I want to add video to the mix to 
help introduce the global Node.js community to some important faces in the ever 
evolving Node.js Ecosystem.

### Going to Market with Node

Register now for Dan Shaw’s event on Crowdcast, scheduled to go live on Tuesday January 09, 2018 at 10:00 am PST.
In this show, I will be joined by [David Moore](https://twitter.com/grajagandev), Founder/CEO of [FuzzStati0n](https://fuzzstati0n.com/), and 
[Joe Doyle](https://twitter.com/joedoyle23), Head of Engineering at [Woebot](https://woebot.io/). We will discuss our experiences 
Going to Market with Node.js. We will explore the unique opportunities and challenges 
the Node.js Ecosystem presents. We will dive into why multi-platform product companies
are choosing to launch in the Node.js Ecosystem first.
If you are building products with Node.js or are selling to Node.js users, 
you won’t want to miss this show. Bring your questions and experiences. 
You will have the opportunity to join us live on screen.

## Strategic Initiatives

### Node.js End User Feedback

![Node.js End User Feedback](https://s3.amazonaws.com/revue/items/images/002/569/937/mail/ashim-d-silva-149106.jpg?1515390292)

The @nodejs Benchmarking WG wants your feedback. With the help of the Node.js End User 
Feedback team and the Node.js Foundation, 
we’ve created a survey. Your input will help prioritize Node.js benchmarking efforts in 
2018.

On Friday, February 9th, we will hold [the first public feedback session](https://github.com/nodejs/user-feedback/issues/27) which 
will focus on Enterprise user feedback.


### CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation)
Now that the Node.js End User Feedback initiative is fully setup and on a regular 
cadence, I am ready to head up a new initiative. In an effort to learn how we can 
improve governance and process for Node.js, I have begun to work with some folks in the 
CNCF to explore best practices for defining and distributing system policies in a 
Cloud Native environment. I expect the initial proposal to finalize this month.


## News

January will be a travel heavy month for me. Mid-month I will be heading to 
Ireland to meet with Cian O'Maidin and the team at [nearForm](http://nearform.com/). From there 
I head to Toronto, then L.A before returning to San Francisco at the end of the month. 
I have a couple meeting slots available during the L.A. leg. 
Get in touch if you want to meet while I’m in Los Angeles from January 24-26.
